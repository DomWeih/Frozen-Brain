Frozen Brain is a prototype I developed as a part of my studies in Game Design.
It's a game about managing and building a cryonics company with a dark twist.
Not only are you going to build up the company but you're also having connections to the blackmarket,
you will be able to sell the organs of the frozen bodies of your customers or even let the whole body "disappear".
